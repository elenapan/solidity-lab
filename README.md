# Description
This repo includes the Truffle configuration files needed for deploying a smart contract either to a local blockchain generated by Ganache, or to the Ropsten Test Network.

Only the needed files are uploaded here. You will have to initialize a truffle project first, and then copy the contents of this repo inside it.

A sample smart contract is also included.
